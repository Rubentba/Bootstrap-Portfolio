                            <p>I'm a student at the University of Central Florida pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I intend to use this degree to obtain a career as a full-stack developer.

                                From a very young age technology has fascinated me. Constantly tinkering, disassembling, and reassembling, I have always enjoyed the challenge of learning more about something that at one point seemed so foreign to me. Yet, after all this time, anything and everything technological still interests me to this day.
                                
                                I have experience with web development tools such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, Javascript, and AJAX as well as passion for working in diverse groups of individuals such as those seen in the technology industry.
